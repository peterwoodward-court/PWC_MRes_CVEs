# PWC_MRes_CVEs
This document contains information regarding the thesis submission images and notebooks.

sg2.ipynb is the jupyternotebook used in the VM for working with styleGAN2. It contains the custom methods used to access images from our storage bucket amongst other methods. cyclegan_main.ipynb is the notebook used for cycleGAN. The original repositories can be found here: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2 https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix 

The images folder contains full resolution images of our output and other figures from the thesis. Images 1-10 are the ones that were sent to the retinal specialists. The images that start 'Normal_image' are example outputs from cycleGAN, for a given number fake_A and real_A demonstrate a comparison between images with and without signs of drusen. The rest of the images are larger versions of those found and referenced in the thesis.
